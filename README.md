This repository is all abour autoencoders.
I have used the concept of autoencoding in two machine learning domains: 1. Dimensionality reduction for images 2. Denoising an image The single .ipynb file denoises an image. First, a Gaussian noise has been injected into an image and then we predict the original image by denoising it. The model is at 79% accuracy till now. The .py file trains a total of 2517 images from the amazon folder of the office31 dataset.
