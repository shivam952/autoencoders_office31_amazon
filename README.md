This repository is all abour autoencoders.
I have used the concept of autoencoding in two machine learning domains: 1. Dimensionality reduction for images  2. Denoising an image
The single ipynb file denoises an image. First a gaussian noise has been injected in an image and then we predict the original image by denoising it. The model is at 79% accurracy till now.
The .py file trains a total of 2517 images from the amazon folder of the office31 dataset.
